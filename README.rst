PyCCX - a library for creating and running 3D FEA simulations using the opensource Calculix FEA Package.

The aims of this project was to provide a simple framework for implemented 3D FEA Analysis using the opensource
`Calculix <http://www.calculix.de>`_ solver.
The analysis is complimented by use of the recent introduction of the
`GMSH-SDK <http://https://gitlab.onelab.info/gmsh/gmsh/api>`_ , an extension to `GMSH <http://gmsh.info/>`_ to provide
API bindings for different programming languages by the project authors to provide sophisticated 3D FEA mesh
generation outside of the GUI implementation. This project aims to provide an integrated approach for generating full
3D FEA analysis for use in research, development and prototyping in a Python environment. Along with setting up and
processing the analysis, convenience functions are included.

The inception of this project was a result of finding no native Python/Matlab package available to perform full
non-linear FEA analysis of 3D CAD models in order to prototype a concept related to 3D printing. The project aims to
compliment the work of the `PyCalculix project <https://github.com/spacether/pycalculix>`_, which currently is limited
to providing capabilities to generate 2D Meshes and FEA analysis for 2D planar structures. The potential in the
future is to provide a more generic extensible framework compatible with different opensource and commercial FEA
solvers (e.g. Abaqus, Marc, Z88, Elmer).

An interface that built upon GMSH was required to avoid the use of the GUI, and the domain specific .geo scripts.

Structure
##############

PyCCX framework consists of classes for specifying common components on the pre-processing phase, including the following
common operations:

* Generation of 2D/3D Compatible Analysis Meshes for use with Calculix
* Creation and assignment of thhermal and mechanical boundary conditions
* Creation of load cases
* Creation and assignment of material models
* Control and running the simulation analyses for Calculix

In addition, a meshing class provides an interface with GMSH for performing the meshing routines and for associating
boundary conditions with the elements/faces generated from geometrical CAD entities. The Simulation class assembles
the analysis and performs the execution to the Calculix Solver. Results obtained upon completion of the analysis can
be processed. Currently the analysis is unit-less, therefore the user should ensure that all constant, material
parameters, and geometric lengths are consistent - by default GMSH assumes 'mm' units.

Current Features
******************

**Meshing:**

* Integration with GMSH for generation 3D FEA Meshes (Tet4, Tet10 currently supported)
* Merging CAD assemblies using GMSH
* Creation of NodeSets, ElementSets, SurfaceSets for boundary conditions
* Attachment of boundary conditions to geometrical CAD entities via GMSH (native .step import supported via OCC)

**FEA Capabilities:**

* **Boundary Conditions** (Acceleration, Convection, Fixed Displacements, Forces, Fluxes, Pressure, Radiation)
* **Loadcase Types** (Structural Static, Thermal, Coupled Thermo-Mechanical)
* **Materials** (Non-linear Elasto-Plastic Material) with user defined stress-strain curves and physical properties
* **Results** (Selection of exported results for nodal and element data per loadcase)
* **Analysis Types** configurable solver control (:auto-incrementing timestep, non-linear analysis)

**Results Processing:**

* Element and Nodal Results can be obtained across timesteps
* Results can be processed and visualised using the `pyccx.results` module
* Results can be exported to VTK for visualisation directly in Paraview
* Extraction of node and element results directly from the Calculix .frd and datafile


Installation
*************
Installation is currently supported on Windows, all this further support will be added for Linux environments. PyCCX
can be installed along with dependencies for GMSH automatically using

.. code:: bash

    pip install pyccx

alternatively, the package can be installed using the uv library:

.. code:: bash

    uv pip install pyccx

Depending on your environment, you will need to install the latest version of Calculix. This can be done through
the conda-forge `calculix package <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/calculix>`_ in the Anaconda distribution,

.. code:: bash

    conda install -c conda-forge calculix


or alternatively downloading the package directly. On Windows platforms the path of the executable needs to be
initialised before use, but can be separately obtained from within the distribution of `prepromax <https://prepomax.fs.um.si>`_

.. code:: python

    from pyccx.core import Simulation

    # Set the path for Calculix in Windows
    Simulation.setCalculixPath('Path')


Usage
******

The following code excerpt shows an example for creating and running a steady state thermal analysis of model using PyCCX
of an existing mesh generated using the pyccx.mesh.mesher class.

.. code:: python

    from pyccx.core import DOF, ElementSet, NodeSet, SurfaceSet, Simulation
    from pyccx.results import ElementResult, NodalResult, ResultProcessor
    from pyccx.loadcase import  LoadCase, LoadCaseType
    from pyccx.material import ElastoPlasticMaterial

    # Set the path for Calculix in Windows
    Simulation.setCalculixPath('Path')

    # Create a thermal load case and set the timesettings
    thermalLoadCase = LoadCase('Thermal Load Case')

    # Set the loadcase type to thermal - eventually this will be individual analysis classes with defaults
    thermalLoadCase.setLoadCaseType(LoadCaseType.THERMAL)

    # Set the thermal analysis to be a steady state simulation
    thermalLoadCase.isSteadyState = True

    # Attach the nodal and element result options to each loadcase
    # Set the nodal and element variables to record in the results (.frd) file
    nodeThermalPostResult = NodalResult('VolumeNodeSet')
    nodeThermalPostResult.useNodalTemperatures = True

    elThermalPostResult = ElementResult('Volume1')
    elThermalPostResult.useHeatFlux = True

    # Add the result configurations to the loadcase
    thermalLoadCase.resultSet = [nodeThermalPostResult, elThermalPostResult]

    # Set thermal boundary conditions for the loadcase using specific NodeSets
    thermalLoadCase.boundaryConditions.append(
        {'type': 'fixed', 'nodes': 'surface6Nodes', 'dof': [DOF.T], 'value': [60]})

    thermalLoadCase.boundaryConditions.append(
        {'type': 'fixed', 'nodes': 'surface1Nodes', 'dof': [DOF.T], 'value': [20]})

    # Material
    # Add a elastic material and assign it to the volume.
    # Note ensure that the units correctly correspond with the geometry length scales
    steelMat = ElastoPlasticMaterial('Steel')
    steelMat.density = 1.0    # Density
    steelMat.cp =  1.0        # Specific Heat
    steelMat.k = 1.0          # Thermal Conductivity

    analysis.materials.append(steelMat)

    # Assign the material the volume (use the part name set for geometry)
    analysis.materialAssignments = [('PartA', 'Steel')]

    # Set the loadcases used in sequential order
    analysis.loadCases = [thermalLoadCase]

    # Analysis Run #
    # Run the analysis
    analysis.run()

    # Open the results  file ('input') is currently the file that is generated by PyCCX
    results = analysis.results()
    results.load()


The basic usage is split between the meshing facilities provided by GMSH and analysing a problem using the Calculix
Solver. Documented examples are provided in`examples <https://github.com/drlukeparry/pyccx/tree/master/examples>`_ .
